# Python Programming Basics
by Yanique Sears

-----

### General Overview
This unit will take place after the AP CSP exam and fit into the AP CSP course. Students will explore text-based programming more in-depth than they would in the actual CSP course. It would focus on teaching some of the basic structures of a text-based language using Python as the language.

---

### Motivation for Unit
Historically, the students I've had in AP CSP preferred block-based programming over text-based due to the Code.org platform offering both. This is fine for AP CSP but if they were looking to move into a more advanced course (like AP CSA), they would need to have a good grasp on text-based languages.

### Standards Referenced
9-12.CT.4 Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

9-12.CT.5 Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.

9-12.CT.6 Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.

9-12.CT.7 Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data.

9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

9-12.CT.9 Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
