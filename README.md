# UNIT PLAN NAME
by TEAM MEMBERS

-----

### General Overview
This unit will take place after the AP CSP exam and fit into the AP CSP course. Students will explore text-based programming more in-depth than they would in the actual CSP course. It would focus on teaching some of the basic structures of a text-based language using Python as the language.

---

### Motivation for Unit
Historically, the students I've had in AP CSP preferred block-based programming over text-based due to the Code.org platform offering both. This is fine for AP CSP but if they were looking to move into a more advanced course (like AP CSA), they would need to have a good grasp on text-based languages.
